# RWS-Windows
Remove-White-Space [Windows]

# CLI 
If you want it to be added to the CLI I can do so soon

# How to use 
Add this as a shortcut on your taskbar, copy something with whitespaces that you want removed, run the program, your text is recopied into the clip board without any whitespaces.

# Why
I made this program for parsing data, I needed to do hex to text but each byte had a white space so I just coded up this program to help me and be fast with doing so.
